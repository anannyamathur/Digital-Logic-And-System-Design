# Digital-Logic-And-System-Design
COL-215 Course Offered By IIT-Delhi in the first semester of the academic year 2020-21 under Professor Anshul Kumar. 

Reference book- [Fundamentals of Digital Logic with VHDL Design](https://www.flipkart.com/fundamentals-digital-logic-vhdl-design-cd-rom/p/itmfbum95rwfqqza)

- [Assignment 1](https://github.com/anannyamathur/Digital-Logic-And-System-Design/blob/main/Assignment%201.pdf)

- Designed a digital clock using VHDL. 

- Designed an image filter in VHDL that uses a 3x3 sliding window for QQVGA size images, with 8-bit pixel resolution. 


- Made use of rotating priorities to modify the arbiter FSM(shown below) to ensure that device 3 will get serviced, such that if it raises a request, the
devices 1 and 2 will be serviced only once before the device 3 is granted its request.
